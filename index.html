            <blockquote>
                Tom Sawyer, an orphan, lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in the fictional town of St.
                Petersburg, Missouri sometime in the 1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is
                made to whitewash his aunt's fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday, as punishment.

            <p>
                In one of the most famous scenes in American literature, Tom cleverly persuades the various neighborhood
                children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the "privilege" of doing his tedious work, using
                <strong>reverse psychology</strong> to convince them it is an enjoyable activity. Tom later trades the
                trinkets with other students for various denominations of tickets, obtained at the local <strong>Sunday
                    school</strong> for memorizing verses of Scripture; he cashes in these in to the minister to win a
                coveted Bible offered to studious children as a prize, despite being one of the worst students in the
                Sunday school and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of
                pride and shock from the adults. Tom falls in love with <strong>Becky Thatcher</strong>, a new girl in
                town and the daughter of a prominent judge.

            <blockquote>
                A poor man named Geppetto wants to carve himself a marionette in order to make a living as a puppeteer.
                He is given a piece of enchanted wood, and as soon as Geppetto carves the puppet, which he names
                Pinocchio, it begins abusing the old man.

            <p>
                Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. Like many Western literary heroes, such
                as <strong>Odysseus</strong>, Pinocchio descends into hell; he also experiences rebirth through
                metamorphosis, a common motif in <strong>fantasy literature</strong>.
                Before writing Pinocchio, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the then-recently
                unified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while
                traveling the country, titled Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino ('Little Johnny's voyage through
                Italy'). Throughout Pinocchio, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of <strong>moral fiber</strong>
                and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun.
                The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folktales of peasants who venture out into
                the world but are naïvely unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations. At the time
                of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from the
                <strong>industrialization</strong> of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the
                cities; the problem was exacerbated by
                similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One
                major effect was the emigration of much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries such
                as the United States.

            <h3>Anna Karenina</h3>
            <div><img src="images/anna.jpg" alt="Anna Karenina image"></div>
            <blockquote>
                A complex novel in eight parts, with more than a dozen major characters, typically contained in two
                volumes. It deals with themes of betrayal, faith, family, marriage, Imperial Russian society, desire,
                and rural vs. city life. The plot centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and dashing cavalry
                officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint Petersburg and
                forces the young lovers to flee to Italy in a search for happiness. After they return to Russia, their
                lives further unravel.
                <i>--- Wikipedia</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Anna Karenina consists of more than the story of <strong>Anna Karenina</strong>, a married socialite,
                and her affair with
                the affluent Count Vronsky, though their story is a very strong component of the plot. The story
                starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled
                womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance
                by others.

                A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry Anna if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior
                government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of
                the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, her love for her son, and Karenin's indecision.
                Although Vronsky and Anna go to <strong>Italy</strong>, where they can be together, they have trouble
                making friends.
                Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social
                life. Despite Vronsky's reassurances, she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about her imagined
                infidelity, fearing her own loss of control.

                A parallel story within the novel is that of <strong>Konstantin Levin</strong>, a wealthy country
                landowner who wants to
                marry Kitty, sister to Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna's brother Stepan Oblonsky. Levin has to propose
                twice before Kitty accepts. The novel details Levin's difficulties managing his estate, his eventual
                marriage, and his struggle to accept the Christian faith, until the birth of his first child.

                The novel explores a <strong>diverse range of topics</strong> throughout its approximately one thousand
                pages. Some of
                these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not
                only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families,
                religion, morality, gender and social class.

            <h3>Don Quixote</h3>
            <div><img src="images/don.jpg" alt="Don Quixote image"></div>
            <blockquote>
                The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) from La Mancha named Alonso Quixano, who
                reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero
                andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He recruits a
                simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire,
                <i>--- Wikipedia</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Cervantes wrote that the first chapters were taken from "the archives of La Mancha", and the rest were
                translated from an <strong>Arabic text</strong> by the Moorish author Cide Hamete Benengeli. This metafictional trick
                appears to give a greater credibility to the text, implying that Don Quixote is a real character and
                that the events related truly occurred several decades prior to the recording of this account. However,
                it was also common practice in that era for <strong>fictional works</strong> to make some pretense of being factual, such
                as the common opening line of fairy tales "Once upon a time in a land far away...".

                In the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goat-herders, soldiers,
                priests, escaped convicts and scorned lovers. The aforementioned characters sometimes tell tales that
                incorporate events from the real world, like the conquest of the <strong>Kingdom of Maynila</strong> or battles in the
                Eighty Years' War. Their encounters are magnified by Don Quixote's imagination into
                chivalrous quests. Don Quixote's tendency to intervene violently in matters irrelevant to himself, and
                his habit of not paying debts, result in privations, injuries, and humiliations (with Sancho often the
                victim). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The <strong>narrator</strong> hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.
